FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: D:\Projects\Graduation Project\Pycode\city_motif_3\city_motif_network_3.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 359
Number of edges: 19300
Number of single edges: 5467
Number of mutual edges: 13833

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1929567 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
103274498 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
105204065 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 7897390 tries were made, 762676 were successful.
Randomization took 14.139 seconds.
Enumeration took 170.71 seconds.
