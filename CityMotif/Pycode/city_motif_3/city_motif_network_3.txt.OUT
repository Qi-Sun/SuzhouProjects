FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: D:\Projects\Graduation Project\Pycode\city_motif_3\city_motif_network_3.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 359
Number of edges: 19300
Number of single edges: 5467
Number of mutual edges: 13833

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1929567 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2103182824 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2105112391 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 157145240 tries were made, 12835164 were successful.
Randomization took 348.397 seconds.
Enumeration took 8830.87 seconds.
