FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: D:\Projects\Graduation Project\Pycode\network.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 43
Number of edges: 650
Number of single edges: 132
Number of mutual edges: 518

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 1000 tries per edge.

8851 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
8993612 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
9002463 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1572057898 tries were made, 402861 were successful.
Randomization took 253.467 seconds.
Enumeration took 6.393 seconds.
